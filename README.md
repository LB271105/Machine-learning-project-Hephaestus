With this model I am trying to predict the grades obtained of students as a function of hours studied. 
In order to run the code you need to have installed: 
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Mathhplotlib
- Scikitlearn
Once installed the model can be used.
The model:
- processes and cleans the data with Pandas
- prepares the data to be read by PyTorch
- builds the neural model using PyTorch
- Trains the model using the gradient optimization method
- Plots the data in a graph using mathplotlib
- Evaluates the efficiency of the model using the determination score method
Once carried out the necessary installations and having performed the necessaey training for the model it can be observed that the model almost correctly predicts the grade obtained based off of the hours studied of a student.
